# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau

# Step One
### Makeover Monday - "What is the world's biggest cash crop?"
This visualization was provided by [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-is-the-worlds-biggest-cash-crop/) with data pulled from sources including the United Nations, FAO, and UNODC. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/valchovalev/agriculture-the-world-s-most-valuable-cash-crop) I used was different than the one provided by Makeover Monday. Instead, I used data provided by the article itself.

This visualization represents the most planted, most fecund, most popular, and most revenue making crops across all continents over 2014. This was one of the most interesting visualizations for me because I appreciated the aesthetics and the content presented. Although crops are initially not the most intriguing topic, after looking at the data, I thought it was really neat how they were able to show which crops brought in the most revenue in comparison to how much it was grown. The immediate surprise caught my attention, and I wanted to look into other ways to represent data and show what the world' biggest cash crop would be.

# Step Two
### Critique
Using the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile from Stephen Few, I graded this visualization on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) based on 7 factors: usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. 
* Usefulness: 7
* Completeness: 6
* Perceptibility: 7
* Truthfulness: 7
* Intuitiveness: 8
* Aesthetics: 9
* Engagement: 8

### General Observations
When looking through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particularly caught my eye. Although this was one of the last links I looked at, I knew I wanted to try with this data. I think this visualization is already rather easy to follow along, but the biggest aspect this is missing is context. The audience is unaware of when this data was collected, if it is historical or from a specific year. For this visualization, this visualization will have to improve on completeness and truthfulness. The viz has great aesthetics. The earth tone color fits the kind of information that they are trying to convey. I think it is a great start but there are minimal changes needed for this. I think something that I would do differently is the scale for each of the categories. To improve this, I need to better understand each of the variables and how to scale them with each other. Since all of these categories are side by side, it has the effect that they are all the same when they are not. I would also change the color from two green and red to include an orange or gold to make it more color-blind friendly. 

### Primary Audience
I think the primary audience is not farmers but instead, lay people who maybe do not understand the farming world. People who are curious about what kind of crops make the most money and get planted the most. I think it may be for policymakers (especially the last Colorado graphic that I did not talk about) who may see this and consider legalizing certain plants because of government revenues. I think the visualization is effective for the lay audience who want a better understanding of what gets planted here. I think there may need to be more data for the policymakers. 

### Final Thoughts
I think this method was mostly effective in evaluating the visualization selected. I think this included some of the most important measures like aesthetics, usefulness, and intuitiveness. I am unsure what other measures I would have wanted included in this critique. I would change how much context is given for this visualization. I would want historical data to perhaps show the growth over time of some crops or the decline of others. I like all four of these categories, but I am unsure how most fecund is important, especially for a lay audience. I would slightly change the colors but maintain the earth tone hues. I would also want a different way to display the variables in a more uniform way or even separate them. Since the question asked is “What is the biggest cash crop?”, we want our audience to understand which one is it almost immediately. That would mean changing the order for most revenue first to the left. 

# Step Three and Four
### Sketches and Feedback 
Based on the critique, I decided to sketch some potential, different visualizations for this type of data. I thought the original one was well done but wanted to think creatively about how to display this data more effectively. Additionally, I have included the feedback I received while I tested my several solutions. I interviewed a student, late teens, and an adult, early 20s. 

### Sketch 1: Line Chart 
<img width="666" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-05 at 9 49 20 PM" src="https://github.com/ErikaHeffernen/Heffernen-Portfolio/assets/70291703/76522da2-04e1-4fc8-a07a-91fb44a4764b">

#### Sketch
One of my questions from the critique was "when did this happen". This visualization incorporates that concept but deviates greatly from the original. This includes 8 groupings of crops instead of the original 21, which was done to reduce to total number of crops and simplify the visualization using groups. The X axis starts in 1960 to 2020, which is the range of years in this dataset. This type of graph was drawn to demonstrate the changing of crop harvesting patterns over time. This way, the audience might be able to deduce that for example sugar crops grow the most over time while oil crops decrease. The Y axis is the area harvested in ha. I do understand that there are four different categories that the original compared which were most planted, fecund, popular, and revenue. For the sake of time, I decided to represent just most planted for this sketch. The colors chosen were inspired by the colors from the original. I wanted to keep the earth tones like orange, green, and brown. 

#### Feedback
The feedback for this first sketch revoled mostly around there being too much presented. The student mentioned how there were too many lines to follow between them, and some of the coloring was too similar to differentiate. However, they did appreciate that there was a progression over time while the original did not have that context. The adult talked mostly about the grouping of crops and how there were too many. For eliminate confusion, they suggested creating even more condensed groups and getting rid of the ones that are not as influential. Overall, they both seemed to like this one but were overwhelmed with how much was going on in the visualization. Going forward, I need to look into other colors that audiences are able to differentiate that still revolve around earth tones. Since 8 is a lot of groups to follow for this type of graph, I might want to look into other ways to group the 21 crops. 

### Sketch 2: World Map
<img width="679" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-05 at 9 50 34 PM" src="https://github.com/ErikaHeffernen/Heffernen-Portfolio/assets/70291703/161a7b77-c8f7-4720-90ed-2d56a30b042a">

#### Sketch
Another lack of context that the original missed was where these crops were planted. This world map sketch incorporated each continent and what percentage of that continent grows a certain crop. Again, the crops were group together for simplicity. Although Africa is the only continent colored in, the plan is to do that for all continents. I decided to create this type of visualization because it helped me put together where in the world certain crops are more popular and how much more are they being produced compared to other continents. This would be difficult to implement via Tableau, but the idea behind it interested me. I used a similar color pallete to the first still creating an earthy aesthetic. 

#### Feedback
There were differing opinions with this visualization. The student thought it was a great way to represent data by area. They thought it would be really interesting to see the breakdown for each continent especially for the topic of production. The one thing they would want to see improved is the color. Once again, it is hard to differentiate the different crops especially close to each other with no outline. The adult found this visualization complicated. They did not know whether that specific region in Africa produced that or if it was a percentage of the continent. Without the answer to that, it was confusing for them to follow along and takeaway main ideas. They did appreciate that they would be able to easily compare how much of each crop is produced. Finally, while talking to my partner in class, they suggested that this visualization would be perfect to show the size of production for each crop specifically. It would be a really interesting way of showing this type of data. Going forward, I would want to implement some of the suggestions my critics raised. The colors should be changed to be easily identified. I would have to specify how each continent is represented for context, and I would want to use this type of visualization for topics like area. 

### Sketch 3: Treemap
<img width="860" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-05 at 9 51 38 PM" src="https://github.com/ErikaHeffernen/Heffernen-Portfolio/assets/70291703/a9b4be9f-606c-4979-8531-e58c41e3885f">

#### Sketch
Although not pictured, there was an additional graphic shown furthur down in the article that uses different sized bubbles to show profit of certain crops. I was inspired by this and decided to create a treemap that showed a closer comparison between the different crop groups. This would make it much easier to directly compare how much a certain crop is being produced and see it in terms of size compared to others. This is a better way to represent the data compared to a bubble chart to show comparison in sizes. Although it does not address the gaps in context like when and where, this does create better understanding of totals and sizes. The same colors from the other two visualizations were used in this as well to maintain the earthy aesthetic. 

#### Feedback 
The student loved this graphic. They had very few questions and very few points to suggest. They really liked how easily it was to comprehend. Similar with the adult, they found it easy to read. Within a second of looking at it, both critics were able to takeaway what the first, second, and third most produced crops were. During our in class activity, my partner suggested that this type of visualization should be used to compare the crops with the most revenue. I found agreed to this idea and would like to implement more of the comparison type data with this visualization. There are minimal changes I would make to this sketch which would include better title, subtitle, and data labels. 

### Sketch 4: Bar Chart
<img width="866" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-05 at 9 52 22 PM" src="https://github.com/ErikaHeffernen/Heffernen-Portfolio/assets/70291703/8d3de132-8c91-47ad-b9ad-3f684b9a631f">

#### Sketch 
Similar to the original, I decided to use a bar graph to represent this data. Since the original was pretty good to start with, I was interested in creating more context for this data, and that was by differentiating the contients within each crop group. This answers the question "where" and could be a great comparison to show which continent is producing the most cereals or fruit while also showing a comparison of all the crops and their total area harvested. This bar graph provides a little more context that audiences are interested in. Only cereals is colored in, but that is what all bars would hypothetically look like. Although these colors are representing different variables now, I still wanted to keep the earthy aesthetic and used similar colors from before. 

#### Feedback
The student liked how they were able to see the breakdown of the continents in this bar chart compared to the original. This gave more context for them which they appreciated. They would want to see more of the bars filled in to really get an idea of how overwhelming the color might be for the audience. The adult thought this took a little longer to understand compared to the other visualizations, but they thought it did the best job explaining the data. For them, it is clear which continent is the biggest contributer to each crop as well as which crop is the biggest. Since it showed data on both of those aspects, they thought it did the best. Other than some potential color issues, I think the critics enjoyed this visualization. I would include more detail in the title and subtitle that may help with the initial understanding of this bar chart.

### Recreation 
Using what I had learned from the critique, I created a dashboard with several treemaps show above. During the last stage of this assignment, I realized that the Makeover Monday dataset was not the same as the data used in the visualization. However, I did find the correct dataset and applied my sketches to it. This new dataset did not include data from different continents or over the last 40 years, so I had to change my final visualization from what I originally drew out. 

I changed the title to "Which crops are the most valuable?" instead of "What is the world's biggest cash crop?" because I could not provide world data to support that title. Additionally, I added a short subtitle that explains the biggest takeaway from these three visualizations. To provide a little more background on this data, I included the year in the subtitle as well. The colors selected were chosen because they matched earthy tones which was something that I appreciated from the original visualization. I stayed away from any bright colors that might pull the attention from the bigger squares in the treemap. Because of the toned down colors, people are able to focus their attention on the size of the rectangles instead. I ultimately decided on the treemap as it was the easiest for my two critics to understand. I appreciate that it includes all the crop groupings but highlighting the most important crops with the biggest squares. In the original visualization, there were a lot of crops that did not have as much significance in the story. Based on suggestion, I created 8 crop groupings based on the type of crop. For example, cereals included crops like wheat, barley, maize and rice. This is much less overwhelming for the audience compared to 21 crops. Although the original visualization had four bar charts, I decided to only include three. Most harvested shows in square kilometers how much each crop group is harvested while the most revenue shows which groups created the most revenue. The new visualuzation is how valuable a crop is in terms of the revenue per square kilometer harvested. I included the previous two charts as context to this final chart which addresses the title question. 

Looking at my redesign compared to the original design, it is hard to determine whether this is better. In some ways, I appreciate the original with how they were able to lead the audience to answer which crop creates the most revenue. However, I do like how my chart makes it more obvious which crop grouping is most valuable in size. People are able to understand the scale of how much more valuable it is compared to others. Additionally, I was able to provide more context by including a subtitle and year for the data. This way, the main idea of the visualization is obvious for the audience.
