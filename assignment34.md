# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau

# Step One
### Makeover Monday - "What is the world's biggest cash crop?"
This visualization was provided by [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-is-the-worlds-biggest-cash-crop/) with data pulled from sources including the United Nations, FAO, and UNODC. This visualization represents the most planted, most fecund, most popular, and most revenue making crops across all continents over 2014.

# Step Two
### Critique
Using the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile from Stephen Few, I graded this visualization on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) based on 7 factors: usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. 
* Usefulness: 7
* Completeness: 6
* Perceptibility: 7
* Truthfulness: 7
* Intuitiveness: 8
* Aesthetics: 9
* Engagement: 8

### General Observations
When looking through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particularly caught my eye. Although this was one of the last links I looked at, I knew I wanted to try with this data. I think this visualization is already rather easy to follow along, but the biggest aspect this is missing is context. The audience is unaware of when this data was collected, if it is historical or from a specific year. For this visualization, this visualization will have to improve on completeness and truthfulness. The viz has great aesthetics. The earth tone color fits the kind of information that they are trying to convey. I think it is a great start but there are minimal changes needed for this. I think something that I would do differently is the scale for each of the categories. To improve this, I need to better understand each of the variables and how to scale them with each other. Since all of these categories are side by side, it has the effect that they are all the same when they are not. I would also change the color from two green and red to include an orange or gold to make it more color-blind friendly. 

### Primary Audience
I think the primary audience is not farmers but instead, lay people who maybe do not understand the farming world. People who are curious about what kind of crops make the most money and get planted the most. I think it may be for policymakers (especially the last Colorado graphic that I did not talk about) who may see this and consider legalizing certain plants because of government revenues. I think the visualization is effective for the lay audience who want a better understanding of what gets planted here. I think there may need to be more data for the policymakers. 

### Final Thoughts
I think this method was mostly effective in evaluating the visualization selected. I think this included some of the most important measures like aesthetics, usefulness, and intuitiveness. I am unsure what other measures I would have wanted included in this critique. I would change how much context is given for this visualization. I would want historical data to perhaps show the growth over time of some crops or the decline of others. I like all four of these categories, but I am unsure how most fecund is important, especially for a lay audience. I would slightly change the colors but maintain the earth tone hues. I would also want a different way to display the variables in a more uniform way or even separate them. Since the question asked is “What is the biggest cash crop?”, we want our audience to understand which one is it almost immediately. That would mean changing the order for most revenue first to the left. 

# Step Three
### Sketches
Based on the critique, I decided to sketch some potential, different visualizations for this type of data. I thought the original one was well done but wanted to think creatively about how to display this data more effectively.
