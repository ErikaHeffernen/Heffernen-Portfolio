# Part 2 - Final Project

## Wireframes and Storyboards 
The wireframes and storyboards have been incorporated into a draft of the project found on Shorthand. Within the site, there are 8 distinct sections that I have taken screenshots of and attached. Each section addresses an important aspect of the story I wanted to portray.

1. This is the opening of my project. It addresses the main subject which is the increase in colorectal cancer incidences in young adults. Beneath that is a description of how prevalent CRC is in our population. I decided to use an image of a drug or medicine used in cancer trials as the background to indicate the seriousness of this topic. The duller aesthetic of this image also adds to the idea that it is gloomy and concerning. 
2. The site moves into a description of colorectal cancer for those who are unaware. It breaks down the science behind this type of cancer with a visual of a colon and the different sections the cancer could impact. Although this visual is more whimsical, I thought it was good to have some visual graphics for those who learn visually. This section also describes the stages of the cancer. The theme moved to an even darker aesthetic which was chosen for two reasons. It was a more seamless transition from the previous image and it kept a darker, serious tone.
3. Section 3 gets into the data part of the project. Here, the audience is introduced to the incidence and mortality rate for both sexes of all ages. They also learn of the incidence rates for 50-65 year olds and 65+. This is one of the most important sections as it provides context that older generations are seeing a decline in incidences over time.
