# Part 1: Final Project

## Outline
#### High Level Summary
Doctors have seen colon cancer become one of the most prevalent cancers in younger adults in recent years. Although they are unsure of the exact cause as of yet, it is interesting to understand the demographics and lifestyle choices that might affect someoneâ€™s likelihood of colon cancer. Known more properly as colorectal cancer, it is historically been seen in older groups. As a young adult, I have heard of people my age who had colon cancer. It is scary to think that the type of food I eat or my ethnicity could potentially make me more likely to contract this cancer. Without reading more into the topic myself and learning from others around me, I would not have heard of this increase in younger generations. Colon cancer was traditionally something my parents would have to worry about, not me as a 22-year-old woman. 

Through this final project, I want to learn more about this topic: what is going on, who is more prone to have it, and what to do if you want to take care of your colon seriously. To continue with this project, I think the audience would need to know historically what is the rate of colon cancer for younger adults and how that has changed over time. They would need to know what demographics and geographical areas are more prone to colon cancer. They would need to know any additional factors that may lead to this cancer like diet, activity, etc. After looking at my project, I hope that my audience regularly checks their bowel movements. Older generations go as far as participating in colonoscopies. 

#### One Sentence Summary
Colorectal cancer has become a growing concern for younger adults in recent years. 

## Initial Sketches

## Data
At this moment in time, I have found one that is publicly available. It does not possess just one dataset, instead, there is a dashboard and data you can download from that. I plan to use this source for some of the sketches that I created. The CDC or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is an American-based organization that works to protect and provide resources for those with a disease, cancer, and other safety threats. Within the CDC website, the United States Cancer Statistics: Data Visualization dashboard provides data on ethnicity, age, sex, race, etc. They provide data on the most common cancers like colorectal. This data is recent running from 2016 to 2020. 


I plan to use this data for the colon cancer in young adults chart, mortality rates based on ethnicity and sex. They provide pretty interesting visualizations already, but I think I would combine different datasets to help with my plans. This would not be the only source I use, but this is the only public source that I was able to find so far for my final project.

## Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand and Tableau throughout this final project. These platforms will be able to provide high-quality analyses and visualizations for this project. I am excited to better understand Shorthand and how to build a story through that.
