## Changes Made
- I ultimately decided to change the colors for the line charts for incidence and mortality rates. This is because I wanted to make sure the audience was able to differentiate between the different categories. Previously, it was not obvious enough, so the audience did not pick up that information. With these new colors, it is easier to differentiate and interpret. I tried to make the combinations of colors that were much more different from each other.
- I changed the title of the lifestyle charts. My critics from class informed me that the previous titles were confusing and took away from the story. By changing these titles, the audience will have an easier time interpreting that part of the story.
- Overall, I decided to minimize my word count. This was done, so that my images and visualizations were the main part of my project. I kept words that I felt were necessary to follow along if I were not there to assist.
- I decided to simplify the testing chart. The feedback I received indicated that it was difficult to follow the original chart. Although there is less information presented on this chart, it is much easier to follow along. This way, people can easily compare and contrast the different kinds of testing available for CRC.
- The last major part of the story that I altered was the final learn more section. This section includes an information site, colonoscopy preparation for those interested in participating, and further information and what you need to know going forward with CRC. One of my critics also mentioned how they did not know how to sign up for a colonoscopy and would like resources for that, so I included it.  These new boxes are more sleep compared to the previous 2. 

## Audience
My audience for this final data story is young adults, specifically in the age range of 18-50. This is the demographic that may not know they are increasing risk of colorectal cancer. Through this story, I hope that they learn about the new trends with younger adults, what types of lifestyles may put them at more risk, and what to do if they are concerned with their health on this topic. From my interviews, it was great to understand how my target audience perceives this information. I tried to incorporate their feedback into my story if they did not understand a graph or asked questions. It was interesting learning from my target age group. Going forward, I think I would have liked to grab people in the middle age group, like 30-40. I did not use personas for this project.

1 The large intestine/colon graphic was made in Canva. I decided to use a purple hue here because it stood out from the background and was not overwhelming. It was rather difficult to create that image and create separate sections for it.

2-3 The incidence rates per sex all ages has a softer color compared to the mortality rates per sex all ages. This was done on purpose. Mortality is a darker subject and was appropriately given a darker color. Both of these graphics were created in Canva to create a seamless transition. 

4-5 The incidence rates for 50-64 and 65+ were treated similarly to the previous. The first one was a lighter color than the following, so the audience can tell the difference between the two visualizations. Both of these graphics were created in Canva to create a seamless transition. 

6-7 The incidence rate for young adults is a softer color than the mortality rate. Again, the mortality rate is darker so that the audience understands the gravity of the topic but can also tell the difference during the transition. Both of these graphics were created in Canva to create a seamless transition. 

8 This graphic was to demonstrate that 1 out of every 5 new incidences will be a younger adult. This helps the audience put into perspective just how serious this new trend is with CRC. I decided not to overload the audience with color, so I kept this black and grey. I think it still stands out well. This was created in Canva. 

9 This visualization is the only one that the audience can play around with. They can adjust the year, and the United States map shows which states have a higher rate of CRC. I decided to lean into heuristics when deciding on the color. The audience can easily understand that red means more CRC incidences while green means less. This visualization was created in Tableau. 

10-14 These visualizations were created in the same manner. Although they were all created in Tableau, to make the scrollmation work, I had to make them images. The colors were not as meaningful as the previous graphics. I decided to use colors given by Tableau that were differentiable. The audience should be able to tell a clear difference when scrolling through all of these. 

15 This last visualization was created on Canva. I decided on a simplified chart compared to my first draft, so the audience can easily pick out what type of test may fit their situation. The colors of this chart match the original large intestine colors to keep the color scheme mostly consistent.
