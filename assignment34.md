# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau

# Step One
### Makeover Monday - "What is the world's biggest cash crop?"
This visualization was provided by [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-is-the-worlds-biggest-cash-crop/) with data pulled from sources including the United Nations, FAO, and UNODC. This visualization represents the most planted, most fecund, most popular, and most revenue making crops across all continents over 2014.

# Step Two
### Critique
Using the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile from Stephen Few, I graded this visualization on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) based on 7 factors: usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. 
* Usefulness: 7
* Completeness: 6
* Perceptibility: 7
* Truthfulness: 7
* Intuitiveness: 8
* Aesthetics: 9
* Engagement: 8

### General Observations
When looking through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particularly caught my eye. Although this was one of the last links I looked at, I knew I wanted to try with this data. I think this visualization is already rather easy to follow along, but the biggest aspect this is missing is context. The audience is unaware of when this data was collected, if it is historical or from a specific year. For this visualization, this visualization will have to improve on completeness and truthfulness. The viz has great aesthetics. The earth tone color fits the kind of information that they are trying to convey. I think it is a great start but there are minimal changes needed for this. I think something that I would do differently is the scale for each of the categories. To improve this, I need to better understand each of the variables and how to scale them with each other. Since all of these categories are side by side, it has the effect that they are all the same when they are not. I would also change the color from two green and red to include an orange or gold to make it more color-blind friendly. 

### Primary Audience
I think the primary audience is not farmers but instead, lay people who maybe do not understand the farming world. People who are curious about what kind of crops make the most money and get planted the most. I think it may be for policymakers (especially the last Colorado graphic that I did not talk about) who may see this and consider legalizing certain plants because of government revenues. I think the visualization is effective for the lay audience who want a better understanding of what gets planted here. I think there may need to be more data for the policymakers. 

### Final Thoughts
I think this method was mostly effective in evaluating the visualization selected. I think this included some of the most important measures like aesthetics, usefulness, and intuitiveness. I am unsure what other measures I would have wanted included in this critique. I would change how much context is given for this visualization. I would want historical data to perhaps show the growth over time of some crops or the decline of others. I like all four of these categories, but I am unsure how most fecund is important, especially for a lay audience. I would slightly change the colors but maintain the earth tone hues. I would also want a different way to display the variables in a more uniform way or even separate them. Since the question asked is “What is the biggest cash crop?”, we want our audience to understand which one is it almost immediately. That would mean changing the order for most revenue first to the left. 

# Step Three and Four
### Sketches and Feedback 
Based on the critique, I decided to sketch some potential, different visualizations for this type of data. I thought the original one was well done but wanted to think creatively about how to display this data more effectively. Additionally, I have included the feedback I received while I tested my several solutions. I interviewed a student, late teens, and an adult, early 20s.

### Sketch 1: Line Chart 
#### Sketch
One of my questions from the critique was "when did this happen". This visualization incorporates that concept but deviates greatly from the original. This includes 8 groupings of crops instead of the original 21, which was done to reduce to total number of crops and simplify the visualization using groups. The X axis starts in 1960 to 2020, which is the range of years in this dataset. This type of graph was drawn to demonstrate the changing of crop harvesting patterns over time. This way, the audience might be able to deduce that for example sugar crops grow the most over time while oil crops decrease. The Y axis is the area harvested in ha. I do understand that there are four different categories that the original compared which were most planted, fecund, popular, and revenue. For the sake of time, I decided to represent just most planted for this sketch. The colors chosen were inspired by the colors from the original. I wanted to keep the earth tones like orange, green, and brown.

### Sketch 2: World Map
#### Sketch
Another lack of context that the original missed was where these crops were planted. This world map sketch incorporated each continent and what percentage of that continent grows a certain crop. Again, the crops were group together for simplicity. Although Africa is the only continent colored in, the plan is to do that for all continents. I decided to create this type of visualization because it helped me put together where in the world certain crops are more popular and how much more are they being produced compared to other continents. This would be difficult to implement via Tableau, but the idea behind it interested me. I used a similar color pallete to the first still creating an earthy aesthetic.

### Sketch 3: Treemap
#### Sketch
Although not pictured, there was an additional graphic shown furthur down in the article that uses different sized bubbles to show profit of certain crops. I was inspired by this and decided to create a treemap that showed a closer comparison between the different crop groups. This would make it much easier to directly compare how much a certain crop is being produced and see it in terms of size compared to others. This is a better way to represent the data compared to a bubble chart to show comparison in sizes. Although it does not address the gaps in context like when and where, this does create better understanding of totals and sizes. The same colors from the other two visualizations were used in this as well to maintain the earthy aesthetic.

### Sketch 4: Bar Chart
#### Sketch 
Similar to the original, I decided to use a bar graph to represent this data. Since the original was pretty good to start with, I was interested in creating more context for this data, and that was by differentiating the contients within each crop group. This answers the question "where" and could be a great comparison to show which continent is producing the most cereals or fruit while also showing a comparison of all the crops and their total area harvested. This bar graph provides a little more context that audiences are interested in. Only cereals is colored in, but that is what all bars would hypothetically look like. Although these colors are representing different variables now, I still wanted to keep the earthy aesthetic and used similar colors from before.
