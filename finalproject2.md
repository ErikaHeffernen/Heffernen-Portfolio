# Part 2 - Final Project

## Wireframes and Storyboards 
The wireframes and storyboards have been incorporated into a draft of the project found on Shorthand. Within the site, there are 8 distinct sections that I have taken screenshots of and attached. Each section addresses an important aspect of the story I wanted to portray.

1. This is the opening of my project. It addresses the main subject which is the increase in colorectal cancer incidences in young adults. Beneath that is a description of how prevalent CRC is in our population. I decided to use an image of a drug or medicine used in cancer trials as the background to indicate the seriousness of this topic. The duller aesthetic of this image also adds to the idea that it is gloomy and concerning. 
2. The site moves into a description of colorectal cancer for those who are unaware. It breaks down the science behind this type of cancer with a visual of a colon and the different sections the cancer could impact. Although this visual is more whimsical, I thought it was good to have some visual graphics for those who learn visually. This section also describes the stages of the cancer. The theme moved to an even darker aesthetic which was chosen for two reasons. It was a more seamless transition from the previous image and it kept a darker, serious tone.
3. Section 3 gets into the data part of the project. Here, the audience is introduced to the incidence and mortality rate for both sexes of all ages. They also learn of the incidence rates for 50-65 year olds and 65+. This is one of the most important sections as it provides context that older generations are seeing a decline in incidences over time.
4. Moving on to the main topic of the project. I decided to change the color of this section so that the audience understands that they are moving in a new direction with new information. In this section, they learn the growing incidence and mortality rates for younger adults which should spark a sense of alarm. This section has the data that proves that there has been growth in those statistics as the title indicates.
5. Continuing onto slide 5, one journal I read had an interesting visualization of geographically which areas are more prone to CRC. This section shows the mainland United States from 1990 to 2019. The audience can look at over time what regions have a greater prevalence. This section remained white because it is similar to the topic explained above.
6. In addition to the general CRC prevalence, I was interested in looking at what regions had certain lifestyles. This next section is a continuation of the previous graphic. These visualizations express which areas have that certain lifestyle and have CRC. The audience can connect that certain areas may have these characteristics which may lead to a higher concentration of CRC.
7. The next section talks about the call to action, so I decided to bring the color back to the original deep blue. This area references the type of lifestyles from the previous visualizations. I have included a few photos of some of the most important risk-reducing strategies. This area is more word-heavy because it describes the best practices. There is also a chart with different screening tests which is the fifth action item for the audience.
8. The final section is a call to action for the audience to keep in mind if they are worried they might have CRC. This section is different from the previous one because those are preventative measures. This section is if the audience believes they could have CRC. I included different links to more professional and knowledgeable sources like the Mayo Clinic and the American Cancer Society.

## Data Visualizations
I have included a total of 14 visualizations that I have created or redesigned using data found from notable websites. I decided to include 10 in this description as the lifestyle graphics are very similar.

1. The first graphic is the compounding illustration of the colon. 4 different segments of the colon are highlighted to help with the understanding. As you continue to scroll, more and more of the colon receives color. This was the easiest way for people to understand and follow along visually with the description of the colon.
2. The second visualization shows the colorectal cancer incidences separated by sex and includes all ages. Blue was chosen for the male incidences but purple was selected for women. The previous graphic used purple, so I decided to continue that aesthetic.
3. The third visualization is similar to the second except it shows the mortality rate over time instead. I decided to use a deeper, darker color because the mortality rate is a more serious topic. The colors are relatively close, so I am still investigating ways for the audience to clearly understand that they are two different charts by looking at other factors than the color and title.
4. The fourth visualization is looking at CRC incidence rates by sex and by age. This age group is from 50 to 64 years old. I decided to keep the same format as the previous two graphs but change the color. This change in color helps the audience understand that it is a different topic that is being covered.
5. The fifth visualization is looking at the CRC incidence rate by sex and by age, this time covering 65 and older groups. The main idea from all the line charts so far is to demonstrate that the overall trend is that CRC is decreasing both in incidences and mortality.
6. This sixth visualization shows the opposite trend. This graph is one of the most important of the project as it directly demonstrates the title. I kept a similar format as the previous four graphics but used different colors once again to let the audience know that the premise had changed.
7. This visualization is similar to the sixth, but this one includes the mortality rate instead of incidence. The downward trend is not as noticeable but still exists. I make the yellow and red colors darker to make it more serious. These colors are very similar, so I am looking at other ways to show this chart with color.
8. The people graphic shows some perspective as to how many people with CRC are younger than 55. It is simple and uses simple colors, so it is not distracting from the other graphics. I decided to add this because it creates a good break from the incidence rate and the mortality rate.
9. The ninth visualization is made and accessed through Tableau. The audience can click and look at all of the mainland states from 1990 to 2019. This is a great graphic to look at which regions of the United States have a higher prevalence of CRC. The colors ranged from green (lower prevalence) to red (higher prevalence). I decided to lean into the red/green bad/good heuristic for this one.
10. The final visualization is one of the 5 in the scrollmation. This one specifically shows where the population has CRC and is medically obese. Each lifestyle topic has its individual color. The one shown is orange. The darker the color, the more prevalent. The one thing that was hard to incorporate was the source, so that is one of the work-in-progress items.

## User Research: Protocol
#### Target Audience
The target audience is younger adults who are concerned about their health. I believe this is general knowledge that younger adults should take with them. There may come a time when information like this is helpful for them and helps them diagnose systems quicker. It may save their lives potentially.  

#### Representative Individuals 
- 1 late teenager - Although they are not in the demographic that I have talked about in the data, I think it is important to understand how younger people feel about the way I presented this data. Since they might not have as much knowledge of data quite yet, it would be interesting to learn more about how they interpret it. 

- 1 early 20s - This is the type of person that I want to reach my project with. They are the ideal demographic. I would be interested to learn more about how they felt and what they took away from the site. I would like to know what stood out to them and made them want to take action.

- 1 mid 50s - This is the other end of the demographic that is experiencing a new trend. I would like to know if they have started to take action on this subject or if they have talked to their doctor about possible conditions. They would be able to add an interesting perspective to the conversation. 

#### Interview Script  

Here are the questions that I asked after they looked through the site on their own. 

1. Now that you have looked at this once, what was the overall message I was trying to convey? 
2. What is one thing that was memorable to you or that you took away from this?
3. Did you feel like the flow of one section to another was seamless? What didnâ€™t work and what did?
4. Do you think the graphics and visualizations helped you with your understanding of the concept?
5. What visualization was the easiest to understand or did you like the most and which visualization/s need more work?
6. Did you understand what you were meant to do after reading this article? 
7. What are some overall/general thoughts and feedback?
