Erika Heffernen's Portfolio - 94470 Telling Stories with Data

# About Me
Hi there! My name is Erika Heffernen, and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am currently an undergraduate senior at the Tepper School of Business. I study business analytics and marketing management, and my favorite classes at CMU revolved around data and how to present it in different ways. After graduation this spring, I will travel to Japan to visit family and sightsee. After that, I will move out west to start my full-time data analyst position at Hewlett Packard (HP). As someone from the East Coast, I can not wait to adventure and discover what the West has to offer! 

In my free time, I love playing softball, listening to music, and playing video games. I was on the Varsity softball team at CMU for the last three years. My favorite song at the moment is Pyramids by Frank Ocean, and my guilty pleasure video game is Sims 4, but I also love to play Skyrim. Some other classes I am taking right now are Elementary Japanese 2 and Ideate: DigiTOOLS. 

# What I hope to learn
This is my final semester at Carnegie Mellon, and I was hoping to take classes that piqued my interest but were also relevant to what I will be doing after graduation. This course particularly interested me because I love trying to think and create different and unique ways of presenting data and information. I hate seeing the same template or charts and get excited when someone presents information in a new way. 

As I mentioned before, I will be working at HP doing data analytics work. My group takes in data from customers about our products. From there, we dig into the data, find key takeaways, and present them to key stakeholders who make decisions on products and our company. It is fulfilling work, but I often present very similar charts and graphs. I hope this class shows the depth of how to make intriguing charts and graphs.
